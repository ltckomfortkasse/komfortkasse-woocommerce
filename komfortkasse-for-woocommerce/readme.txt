Automatic assignment of bank wire transfers


== Description ==
Komfortkasse retrieves bank transfers from a bank account and automatically assignes them to unpaid orders. The assignment is done automatically in the background and is fault-tolerant, i.e. an order can still be assigned if the name does not match, the order number is not specified or the amount differs.

In addition, automatic payment reminders can be sent and refunds can be performed directly.

This extension provides the interface for the Komfortkasse online service, transferring information about open orders to Komfortkasse and retrieveing payment status updates from Komfortkasse. Registration on komfortkasse.eu is required (free package available). You even don\'t need a bank account, you can use Komfortkasse\'s omnibus account. This plugin is designed for SEPA countries. It also works if your company is outside SEPA, but serving customers in that area.
